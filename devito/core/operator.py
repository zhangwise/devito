class OperatorCore(OperatorRunnable):

    def _specialize_exprs(self, expressions, subs):
        """
        Transform the SymPy expressions in input to the Operator into a
        backend-specific representation.

        Three tasks are carried out: ::

            * Indexification (:class:`Function` --> :class:`Indexed`).
            * Application of user-provided substitution rules.
            * Translation of array accesses w.r.t. the computational domain.

        The latter task requires some thought. One may think that adding the
        halo+padding region to the index functions would suffice. There is,
        however, a complication. Consider for example the function `u(t, x, y)`,
        with halo+padding given by ``((0, 0), (3, 3), (3, 3))`` -- see also
        :meth:`Function._offset_domain` for more info about the semantics of the
        halo and padding tuples. A user may express an iteration update in many
        different formats, such as ``u[t+1, x, y] = f(u[t, x, y], u[t-1, x, y])``
        or ``u[t+2, x, y] = f(u[t+1, x, y], u[t, x, y])``. Not only are these
        two formats mathematically meaningful, but also they are considered
        equivalent by Devito. What really matters is that users can execute a
        :class:`Operator` in a natural way. So if the user writes: ::

            .. code-block::
                op = Operator(...)
                op.apply(t=(2, 5))

        then 3 timesteps need to be computed -- in particular, ``u[2, ...],
        u[3, ...], u[4, ....]`` -- no matter whether the left hand side
        of the input equation is expressed as ``u[t+1, ...] = ...`` rather than
        ``u[t+2, ...] = ...`` or ``u[t, ...] = ...``. To systematically achieve
        this behavior, we use the following compilation strategy: ::

            * Any offsets appearing on the left hand side of a user-provided
              equation are dropped; all other index functions are translated accordingly.
            * All index functions are further translated up based on the extent of their
              halo+padding region.
            * A loop along a certain :class:`Dimension` ``x`` enclosing a user-provided
              equation will always range from ``x_start`` to ``x_end`` (i.e., no offsets
              will ever be used in user-input-generated loop headers).

        Thus, for the above scenario, the compiler will eventually generate: ::

            .. code-block::
                for t = t_s to t_e
                  for x = x_s to x_e
                    for y = y_s to y_e
                      u[t, x+3, y+3] = f(u[t-1, x+3, y+3], u[t-2, x+3, y+3])
